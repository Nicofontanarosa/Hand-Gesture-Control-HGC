# Hand-Gesture-Control-HGC
Hand Gesture Control is a computer vision–based system that allows users to control their computer using hand gestures captured through a webcam. Built with OpenCV and MediaPipe, it tracks hand movements in real time and maps gestures to system actions such as mouse movement and clicks, enabling touchless and intuitive human–computer interaction.
